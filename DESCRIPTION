Description: SlimR is an R package designed for annotating single-cell and spatial
    transcriptomics datasets. It supports the creation of a unified marker list,
    "Markers_list", using sources including: the package's built-in curated
    species-specific cell type and marker reference databases (e.g., Cellmarker2,
    PanglaoDB), Seurat objects containing cell label information, or user-provided
    Excel tables mapping cell types to markers.
    Based on the "Markers_list", SlimR can iterate through different cell types to
    generate corresponding annotation reference plots (e.g., Markers_dotplot,
    Metric_heatmap, Mean_expression_bar_plot). Furthermore, it enables one-click
    generation of an annotation heatmap (Annotation_heatmap) visualizing the
    relationship between input cell types and the reference marker list.
