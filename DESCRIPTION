Description: Provide an R software toolkit for annotating single-cell and 
    spatial transcriptomic data based on the Marker dataset. It supports the 
    creation of a unified marker list, "Markers_list", using sources including: 
    the package's built-in curated species-specific cell type and marker 
    reference databases (e.g., "Cellmarker2", "PanglaoDB"), Seurat objects 
    containing cell label information, or user-provided Excel tables mapping 
    cell types to markers.
    Based on the "Markers_list", SlimR can iterate through different cell types 
    to generate corresponding annotation reference plots (e.g., 
    "Markers_Dotplot", "Metric_Heatmap", "Mean_expression_Box_plot"). 
    Furthermore, it enables one-click generation of an annotation heatmap 
    ("Annotation_Heatmap") visualizing the relationship between input cell types
    and the reference marker list.
